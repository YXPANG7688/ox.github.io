A <i><b>shepherd</i></b> boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields near the forest. He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.

<br>
<br>

One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying 
away a lamb!" Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but 
didn't find any wolf.

<br>
<br>

<The boy laughed and replied, "It was just fun. There is no wolf here".
<b><i><big>The boy played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</b></i></big>

<br>
<br>

After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep,
suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs.
The boy was frightened and cried loudly, "Wolf! Wolf!<strike> The wolf is carrying a lamb away!</strike>"

<br>
<br>
</font>
<font face=Arial size=3 color purple>The farmers<sup>thought</sup> the boy was playing<sub>mischief</sub> again.</font>
<font face=Arial size=3>So, no one paid
attention to him and didn't come to his help.
